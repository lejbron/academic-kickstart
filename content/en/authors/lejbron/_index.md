Non-mathematical mindset engineer with more than five years teamwork experience in IT. My main inspiration is discovering new technologies, testing them and implementing in my own projects and job practice. Now I am completely immersed in new work, trying my best to create accessible and easy-to-use documentation for big microservice application.
